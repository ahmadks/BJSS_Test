Assumption taken to complete the test

- Will minimize the number of external jar dependencies in the code.
- Will prioritize a first working version to keep the solution in 3h of development before testing all classes and cases.
- Any element in the basket not declared in Consumer Data will be ignored.
- Main app is in Main.java
